# Exegol environment (container ops)

Baseline reference for the Exegol container layout (tools, resources, inventories, and services).

## Environment map

- Shared “resources” live under `/opt/resources/` (Linux/Windows/macOS tooling, webshells, etc.).
- Tools (including many vendored repos/venvs) live under `/opt/tools/`.
- Shared wordlists/rules live under `/opt/lists/` and `/opt/rules/` and are symlinked into `/usr/share/...`.
- Exegol command templates (raw, no timestamps): `/opt/.exegol_history`
- Exegol aliases (shortcuts/wrappers): `/opt/.exegol_aliases`
- Shell bootstrap (PATH/aliases tooling setup): `/opt/.exegol_shells_rc` (may add `/opt/my-resources/bin` to `PATH` and shadow commands)
- `systemctl` is not usable inside the container; use `service ...` for init scripts when needed.

## Answering “do we have X?” quickly

- Search Exegol aliases: `rg -i "<tool>" /opt/.exegol_aliases`
- Search the tools snapshot: `rg -i "<tool>" exegol-environment/references/installed_tools_latest_nightly_amd64.csv`
- Reality check: `command -v <tool> || ls -la /opt/tools | rg -i "<tool>"`

## Fast workflow

1) Find a tool by name/capability (inventory snapshot):
- `rg -i "<query>" exegol-environment/references/installed_tools_latest_nightly_amd64.csv`
- Reality check (is it actually runnable here?): `command -v <tool> || ls -la /opt/tools | rg -i "<tool>"`

2) Find a bundled resource (e.g. winPEAS, Sysinternals, chisel, ligolo-ng):
- `rg -i "<query>" exegol-environment/references/exegol_resources_list.csv`
- Then check local paths under `/opt/resources/` for the actual files.

3) Locate common data:
- Wordlists: `/opt/lists/` (also `/usr/share/wordlists/`)
- Hashcat rules: `/opt/rules/` (also `/usr/share/hashcat/rules/`)
- Tools checkout/installs: `/opt/tools/`

4) Start common services (when needed):
- See `exegol-environment/references/official_services.md`.
- Prefer `service postgresql start` (etc.) or the tool’s own wrappers (e.g. `neo4j start`).

## Companion playbooks

- CTF workflow rules live in `/workspace/AGENTS.md` (what to prioritize, where to write output, and safety guardrails).
- For web challenges using Burp + MCP, use `burp-mcp/SKILL.md` to triage proxy history and verify hypotheses efficiently.

## What to read (progressive disclosure)

- `exegol-environment/references/container_paths_and_conventions.md`: what’s where in the container.
- `exegol-environment/references/exegol_templates.md`: seeded command templates + aliases + live history pointers.
- `exegol-environment/references/official_credentials.md`: default creds for preconfigured services/tools.
- `exegol-environment/references/official_services.md`: ports + startup commands for bundled services.
- `exegol-environment/references/exegol_resources_list.csv`: official resources list (generated by Exegol CI).
- `exegol-environment/references/installed_tools_latest_nightly_amd64.csv`: tools list snapshot (generated by Exegol CI).

## Keeping official lists fresh

If outbound network access is available, refresh the cached official CSV inventories (otherwise, skip this and rely on the bundled snapshots):

- `bash exegol-environment/scripts/update_official_inventories.sh`
